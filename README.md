# Tasks API 

This project is a simple task API in **Node.js** that allows you to create, edit, delete and list tasks. The main objective was to develop these functionalities using only Node.js internal modules like `http`, `fs` and `crypto`.

Also, this API was developed during the first challenge of Ignite Node.js trail - [**Rocketseat**](https://github.com/rocketseat-education) JavaScript ecosystem specialization program.

Furthermore, I was able to learn the main fundamentals of an API such as routes, HTTP methods, request and response headers, HTTP status code, request body, query params and route params, middleware, in addition to how streams and buffers work within Node.js.
